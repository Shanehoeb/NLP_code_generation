A lot of recent work on both Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative models for text showed particular improvement on the code generation task and reaffirmed the higher importance of this task. 
Inspired by the paper https://github.com/openai/human-eval and the performance of the associated model, Codex, we decide to focus on the code generation task and to discuss the convergence between code generation models and "human-style" logic and development concepts in the process of code generation.

The github is organized in 3 parts :
- 1 for reproducing the rsults -> lien
- 1 for codeT exploration
- 1 for the latent-diffusion for text exploration

# CodeT: Code Generation with Generated Tests

# Overview

In the paper, we present **CodeT** (for **Code** Generation with Generated **T**ests), a simple yet effective approach to empower large pre-trained language models for code generation, which could achieve surprising improvements over previous methods. For example, we improve the pass@1 on HumanEval to 65.8%, an increase of absolute 18.8% on the OpenAI *code-davinci-002* model, and an absolute 20+% improvement over previous state-of-the-art results.

CodeT leverages large language models to generate both the code solutions and the test cases. We believe a solution could get support from both the test cases and the other solutions. The more test cases a solution can pass, and the more test-driven siblings the solution has, the better the solution is. Hence, We execute the code solutions using the test cases and chooses the best solution based on such dual execution agreement.

# Quickstart

## Prepare Environment
First, you should set up a python environment. This code base has been tested under python 3.7.

After installing python 3.7, we strongly recommend you to use `virtualenv` to manage the python environment. You could use following commands to create an environment `venv` and activate it.

```bash
$ python3.7 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prepare Data

First, you can find our processed HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks in the `data/dataset` directory, including the data for code solution and test case generation. Then you may reproduce the results of InCoder and CodeGen on the HumanEval benchmark using the data we provide in the `data/generated_data` directory. Or you can feed the input data to the code generation models (e.g. [CodeGen](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen) and [InCoder](https://github.com/dpfried/incoder)) to generate code solutions and test cases.

Here is an example of the HumanEval benchmark:
```json
{
    "task_id": "HumanEval/23",
    "prompt": "\n\ndef strlen(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Return length of given string\n    \"\"\"\n",
    "entry_point": "strlen",
    "canonical_solution": "    return len(string)\n",
    "test": "\n\nMETADATA = {\n    'author': 'jt',\n    'dataset': 'test'\n}\n\n\ndef check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('') == 0\n    assert candidate('x') == 1\n    assert candidate('asdasnakj') == 9\n"
}
```

And the model output should look like this:
```json
{
    "prompt": "\n\ndef strlen(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Return length of given string\n    \"\"\"\n",
    "samples": ["    length = 0\n    for char in string:\n        length += 1\n    return length\n\n",
                "    count = 0\n    for _ in string:\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\n",
                "    return len(string)\n", "    length = 0\n    for _ in string:\n        length += 1\n    return length\n"]
}
```

## Use CodeT

You may use the script `main.py` to run CodeT, which automatically performs post-processing, dual execution agreement, and pass@k evaluation.
Before running the script, you need to specify several arguments:

```bash
python main.py
    --source_path_for_solution PATH_1 # model input file in .jsonl format
    --predict_path_for_solution PATH_2 # model output file in .jsonl format
    --source_path_for_test PATH_3 # model input file in .jsonl format
    --predict_path_for_test PATH_4 # model output file in .jsonl format
    --cache_dir PATH_5 # the directory to store the cache files (execution results)
    --timeout NUMBER # how many seconds to wait during execution for each test case (default 0.1)
    --test_case_limit NUMBER # first n test cases per sample (default 5)
```

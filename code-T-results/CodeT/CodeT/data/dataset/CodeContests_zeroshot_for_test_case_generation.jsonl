Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8].

Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j.

Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.\n\nTo save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u22c510^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers w_1,w_2,\u2026,w_n (1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, d (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9), denoting a two-way railway connecting station u and station v, with length d.\n\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 \u2264 k_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 4 \u00d7 10^8).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred).\n\n'''\ndef solution(stdin: str) -> str:\n    pass\n\n# check the correctness of solution\nassert ", "test": "", "meta_data": {"task_name": "1580_E.

Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^5, n, m \u2265 2, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 99) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n'''\ndef solution(stdin: str) -> str:\n    pass\n\n# check the correctness of solution\nassert ", "test": "", "meta_data": {"task_name": "1623_D.

Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 \u2264 l_i, r_i \u2264 n). If the node i does not have the left child, l_i = 0, and if the node i does not have the right child, r_i = 0.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given input forms a binary tree, rooted at 1.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line, containing the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree if at most k nodes have their labels duplicated.\n\n'''\ndef solution(stdin: str) -> str:\n    pass\n\n# check the correctness of solution\nassert ", "test": "", "meta_data": {"task_name": "1623_E.
